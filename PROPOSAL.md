In this project, I aim to recreate the [Trash/Garbage](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/trash/) card game but in C++ using the Cinder library.

My reasons for choosing this project:
* I have played this card game for many years, and I found that there are no projects that have been done on this in the past (or at least no public ones), so I wanted to be the first to do it.
* I want to tie my knowledge of C++ and Cinder to a childhood favorite to show how far I've come in my programming endeavors.
* I've made a memory matching game in the past, but that was using HTML/CSS/JS instead of C++, and the logic was not as complex as a full-fledged card game. I wanted to challenge myself this time to have more advanced game logic while also using a different programming language.

Checkpoints:
* Week 1: Finish implementing game logic with various classes for handling plays for each player. This includes logic for each type of card (numeric and royals), deck shuffling, updating board for each player, drawing from and updating stock pile, drawing from and updating discard pile, and keeping track of the score.
* Week 2: Finish Cinder visuals for the game and tie to game logic accordingly. This includes the constantly-updating "board" of 10 cards for each player, the stockpile, the discard pile, the card drawn on each turn, and each player's score.
* Week 3: Finish test cases and clean up code. Ensure game logic works correctly with code. Add/delete code/classes/files where necessary. Work on presentation and submit.

Extra goals:
* Make game functional for more than 2 players.
* Make multiple games possible in one run of the app and decide on a winner from that (e.g. best of 3).
